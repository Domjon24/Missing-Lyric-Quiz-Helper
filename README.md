# Missing-Lyric-Quiz-Helper

<div class="entry-content clearfix"><p>Today I&#8217;ve released v1.0 of my Missing Word Quiz Tool, and below you will find some tips and images to help you get started in finding and working with a few of the new features. This tool is designed to help you find specific words in song lyrics to make missing word quizzes easier to create.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><h3>Pasting Lyrics</h3></strong></p>
<p>If you already have the song lyrics you want, you can just paste them here in the lyric box</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Word Length</strong></p>
<p>Select your desired word length from the number dropdown below. You can pick any number between 1-99. You will need to select a number from this list, otherwise it will give you an error.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Find</strong></p>
<p>Once you enter all the fields, click find and you will get a list of all your selected words. For Example: if you select "4" from the number dropdown, then the tool will return all the 4-letter-words within the lyrics that you pasted</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><h3>Lyric Search</h3></strong></p>
<p>If you don't have the lyrics already and want to generate them automaticlly, click on lyric lookup. On this screen you enter the desired artist name, song title, and word length, then click find. If the song is found, it will return a list of all the words of your selected word length.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Google Search</strong></p>
<p>If we cannot find your song lyrics, you can click the search with google button. This will open a new tab and google search the lyrics using the artist and song title that you already entered. From here you can find the lyrics you want, and paste them in the "paste lyrics" tab.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quiz Editing</strong></p>
<p>
  
</p>
<p>Each word is on its own line so you can paste the results directly into your quiz draft</p>

<p>This is just a demonstration of v1.0 of the missing word tool. More features are coming soon (including searching by letter), and I will also continue to enhance and upgrade quiz tools with new features and adjustments based on your feedback. I hope you like what you see!</p>
